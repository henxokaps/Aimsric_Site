                Doctoral Training Program
            </h5>
            <p>
                In 2019, AIMS started a Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) to develop PhD-level experts. The need for such a centre was made evident by the institution’s internal assessment of the uncoordinated manner in which PhD students had been trained. The centre was established to strengthen research in Africa, with the vision to catalyze human progress through the creation, translation, and dissemination of knowledge;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating new knowledge, including solutions to relevant problems.</li>
                <li>Converting and interpreting data into useful forms in addressing society’s challenges.</li>
                <li>Effective dissemination of knowledge via, for example, journal publications and other media.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The first Doctoral Training Program (DTP) was in Climate Science, and it has already elevated to a much higher level than before the quality of the learning opportunities available to AIMS students. In 2021, AIMS started the second DTP, in Data Science, followed by one in Climate and Health Interactions, and in Malaria Modelling, both in 2023. The next step is to create another DTP in Quantum Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, all DTPs have 55 doctoral students, hailing from different countries across the continent, with the following gender distribution

                AIMS RIC has a very small faculty, so it cannot train as many PhD students as it wants, to the required quality, by relying only on its staff. For future DTPs, we are looking at recruiting people to provide the necessary academic support. In addition, AIMS will continue to rely on a network of external faculty for student (co)supervision. Furthermore, for sustainability, AIMS needs to diversify the sources of funding available to the DTPs. For all these reasons, AIMS RIC needs strong institutional partners to provide support across the board - from planning to fundraising to execution. A lot of work has already gone into developing the required structures for the aforementioned DTPs, and this provides an excellent platform to continue to build on.

            </p>

            <p><b>Standard requirements and qualifications for the DTP</b><br />Following the AIMS RIC PhD student recruitment policy, the program calls for applicants from candidates with the following qualifications;</p>
            <ul>

                Application process
            </h5>
            <p>
                AIMS RIC follows a standard procedure when recruiting suitable candidates for DTPs. The student recruitment process follows the procedure below;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A call for topic submissions from potential supervisors with innovative and impactful research topics that address challenges in the fields of interest.</li>
                <li>After thorough evaluation, selected topics are uploaded on the website, ensuring that they are accessible to all interested parties. </li>
                <li>A call for applications for interested students follows. The students select a maximum of 2 topics from the proposed topics but also have a chance to propose their own topics.</li>
                <li>The received applications are verified for relevant application documents and sent for evaluation and ranking. This rigorous assessment ensures that only the most qualified and motivated candidates are selected to participate in 	the program. Unsuccessful candidates are sent either generic or personalised emails. </li>
                <li>Shortlisted candidates’ application packages are then forwarded to proposed supervisors for evaluation.</li>
                <li>Successful applicants are asked to collaborate with their supervisors to develop full proposals, which are subsequently reviewed before submission to the selection committee.</li>
                <li>Successful proposals receive offer letters, followed by an onboarding process and the official commencement of their positions as AIMS RIC Ph.D. students.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                PhD students are mentored by a team of 2-4 supervisors, creating a partnership between AIMS and higher education institutions both in Africa and internationally. Each supervision team must include at least one supervisor affiliated with AIMS and one affiliated with the graduating institution based in Africa. These guidelines are flexible and can be adjusted on a case-by-case basis.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Student life
            </h5>
            <p>
                The DTP student evaluation process at AIMS RIC is designed to ensure rigorous academic progress and high standards of scientific research. Each PhD student is granted a 36-month fellowship signed in acceptance together with a structured supervisor agreement. The evaluation process includes the submission of quarterly and annual reports, along with mid-year and end-year evaluations during which their progress is closely monitored. This systematic approach aims to maintain scientific rigor and quality control, ensuring that all students meet the program's objectives and contribute meaningfully to their respective fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the requirements of the graduating institution, each student is supported to take extra courses covering fundamental and advanced topics in relevant fields, for example, data science, quantum science, and modelling. We also provide support for students to take specialised courses that allow them to tailor their education to their research interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Training programs:</b> The annual Doctoral Training School (DTS) in foundational methods in data science is a four-week highly interactive session intended for early-stage African PhD students working in data science, broadly defined to include applied mathematics, mathematical modelling, statistics, computer science, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence. This DTS aims to address the skills gap that many African students face when transitioning from taught postgraduate education into PhD research.
            </p>
            <p>
                The DTS focuses on; 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Core Courses such as Machine Learning Essentials, Problem Solving with Data Science, Statistics and Scientific Methods, and Optimization for Data Science Applications</li>
                <li>Special Topics Courses like Introduction to R, Computational Methods for Random Effect Models, Introduction to Generative Modeling, Large Language Models, Functional Data Analysis: Exploring Frontiers and Beyond, and Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning</li>
